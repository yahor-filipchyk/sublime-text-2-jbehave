JBehave Story Syntax - Sublime Text & TextMate plugin
=====================================================

A plugin for [Sublime Text 2][st2] and [TextMate][tm].

[JBehave][jb] is a [Behaviour Driven Development][bdd] framework
for the Java platform that allows business persons to write an
automatable description of the behaviour of an application 
or system:

> The language and its grammar represents the shared understanding of 
> the behaviour between the business users and the development team. And 
> as any language it evolves with the evolution of this shared 
> understanding. BDD provides the grammar, but the language is agreed 
> between the business and the team.


The [JBehave grammar][grmr] is defined in [EBNF][ebnf] at their 
website.

This plugin colors the story text allows visual identification of
subtle errors such as failing to capitalize the 'and' keyword
used to start a new step in the story.
